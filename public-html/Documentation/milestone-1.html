        <p> David is only concerned with one thing: Is this person a potential candidate for the FashionGun Web Dev
            position?
            Can David, within 3 minutes max, determine whether this person is worthy of a preliminary phone screen
            regarding the
            job?
            David doesn't like to waste time. David needs to know via a very fast interaction with the
            site whether or not this potential candidate has the minimum qualifications to warrant a call. </p>
