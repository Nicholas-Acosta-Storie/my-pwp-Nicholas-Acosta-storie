        <h1 class="Profession:"></h1>
        <p>Co-Founder and CTO of FashionGun.com, a startup that is looking to hire a full-time, in-house Front-End Web Developer.
            They have just received their first round of VC seed funding.
            Their product is an online collaboration and project management tool marketed to the fashion industry.</p>

    Technology: Mac power user. Uses a Mac Pro Tower with 2 30” cinema displays while in the office,
    a MacBook Pro laptop at home, and an iPhone 7 plus with an unlimited 4G data connection.
    </p2>
    <p3>
    Attitudes and Behaviors: Short on time, overworked, and has a full social schedule in addition.
    David will not spend more than 3 minutes max looking at anyone’s portfolio site, and only about 30 seconds on a resume.
    David is a huge social media user, and seeks potential candidates through tech and fashion community networking events, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
    </p3>
    <p4>
    Frustrations and Needs: David needs to hire someone with 5-7 years of development experience who is willing to start at a competitive entry-level salary, to start.
    David is also looking for someone who is a good personality and cultural fit for FashionGun as well. FashionGun is still small, and can only offer limited benefits at this time,
    but will include equity options as part of the compensation package.
    Because David is looking to hire within a very competitive urban market,
    he is flooded with candidates but is having a hard time finding someone with the right combination of talent, experience,
    and personality who is willing to accept a slightly lower salary and limited benefits. He must hire within 2 weeks.
    </p4>
    <p5>
    Goals: David is only concerned with one thing: Is this person a potential candidate for the FashionGun Web Dev position?
    Can David, within 3 minutes max, determine whether this person is worthy of a preliminary phone screen regarding the job?
    David doesn't like to waste time. David needs to know via a very fast interaction with the
    site whether or not this potential candidate has the minimum qualifications to warrant a call.
    </p5>
</h4>
    User Story: As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this person is a
    candidate for the mid-level Front End Web Developer position.</h1>
