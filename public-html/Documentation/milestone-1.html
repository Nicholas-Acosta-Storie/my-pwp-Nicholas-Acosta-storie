        <p> Tomas needs a website that will so him new camping sites and other helpful information about camping.
            Tomas is looking for a website that is easy to navagate with and has a lot of information. FashionGun is
            still small, and can only offer limited benefits at this time,
            but will include equity options as part of the compensation package.
            Because David is looking to hire within a very competitive urban market,
            he is flooded with candidates but is having a hard time finding someone with the right combination of talent,
            experience,
            and personality who is willing to accept a slightly lower salary and limited benefits. He must hire within 2 weeks</p>

        <p> David is only concerned with one thing: Is this person a potential candidate for the FashionGun Web Dev
            position?
            Can David, within 3 minutes max, determine whether this person is worthy of a preliminary phone screen regarding the
            job?
            David doesn't like to waste time. David needs to know via a very fast interaction with the
            site whether or not this potential candidate has the minimum qualifications to warrant a call. </p>
